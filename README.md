# daily-proverbs
Originally written around 2013 in plain vanilla JavaScript (< ECMAScript 2015), this short JavaScript was intended to help me in my daily devotional.

Now it's being rewritten in TypeScript.

#TODO
1. Fetch the daily proverb from an API instead of locally storing the entire book of Proverbs in RAM.
2. Make offline mode that defaults to the local book of Proverbs.
3. Use RequireJS.
4. Turn this into a Magento jQuery widget.
5. Package this with Composer to make it a Magento extension.
