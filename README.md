# daily-proverbs
Originally written around 2013 in plain vanilla JavaScript (< ECMAScript 2015), this short JavaScript was intended to help me in my daily devotional.

#TODO
1. Fetch the daily proverb from an API instead of locally storing the entire book of Proverbs in RAM.
  a. http://bibliaapi.com thanks to https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/4813
  b. https://scripture.api.bible
  c. https://bible-api.com
2. Make offline mode that defaults to the local Book of Proverbs.
3. Use RequireJS.
4. Turn this into a Magento jQuery widget.
5. Package this with Composer to make it a Magento extension.
6. Provide a drop-down box to select a language.
7. Provide a drop-down box to select a Bible version.
8. Do the same with the Book of Ecclesiastes.

#DONE
1. Rewrote JavaScript in TypeScript code.
2. Wrapped TypeScript code for displaying daily proverbs in a function, per https://trackjs.com/blog/how-to-wrap-javascript-functions/
