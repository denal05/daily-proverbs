# daily-proverbs
Originally written around 2013 in plain vanilla JavaScript (< ECMAScript 2015), this short JavaScript was intended to help me in my daily devotional.

#TODO
1. Wrap TypeScript code in a function, per https://trackjs.com/blog/how-to-wrap-javascript-functions/
2. Fetch the daily proverb from an API instead of locally storing the entire book of Proverbs in RAM.
  a. http://bibliaapi.com thanks to https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/4813
  b. https://scripture.api.bible
  c. https://bible-api.com
3. Make offline mode that defaults to the local book of Proverbs.
4. Use RequireJS.
5. Turn this into a Magento jQuery widget.
6. Package this with Composer to make it a Magento extension.

#DONE
1. Rewrite JavaScript in TypeScript code.
